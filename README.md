## Introduction
Understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for any programmer looking to enhance their problem-solving skills. This repository serves as a learning hub where you can find Java implementations of various data structures (e.g., linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching). Each implementation is accompanied by explanations and comments to help you grasp the concepts and improve your coding skills.

## Directory Structure
The project follows a structured organization to make it easy for users to navigate and find the desired implementations. Here's a brief overview:

/JavaDSA
|-- src # Source code for data structures and algorithms

| |-- datastructures # Java classes for various data structures

| |-- algorithms # Java classes for algorithms

|-- tests # Test cases for the implemented code

|-- docs # Documentation and explanations

|-- examples # Example usage of the implemented code

|-- .gitignore # Git ignore file

|-- LICENSE # Project license

|-- README.md # Project readme file



Feel free to explore the `src` directory for the source code, `tests` for test cases, `docs` for documentation, and `examples` for example usage of the implemented code.
